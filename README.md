OpenHexa Frontend Component
===========================

OpenHexa is an open-source data integration platform developed by [Bluesquare](https://bluesquarehub.com).

Its goal is to facilitate data integration and analysis workflows, in particular in the context of public health
projects.

Please refer to the [OpenHexa wiki](https://github.com/BLSQ/openhexa/wiki/Home) for more information about OpenHexa.

The OpenHexa `frontend` component is a [Next.js](https://Next.js.org/) application. It is a frontend app designed to
connect to an [OpenHexa](https://github.com/BLSQ/openhexa-app) instance.

The app communicates with OpenHexa through its [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API, and uses the standard OpenHexa
cookie-based authentication.

For more information about the technical aspects of OpenHexa, you might be interested in the two following wiki pages:

- [Installing OpenHexa](https://github.com/BLSQ/openhexa/wiki/Installation-instructions)
- [Technical Overview](https://github.com/BLSQ/openhexa/wiki/Technical-overview)

## Requirements

The Frontend requires at least Node v16 and uses `npm` to manage its
dependencies. Make sure [you upgrade to the last version of `npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm).

## Container

OpenHexa FrontEnd is published as a Docker Image on Docker Hub:
[blsq/openhexa-frontend](https://hub.docker.com/r/blsq/openhexa-frontend)

Run it as it follows:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 blsq/openhexa-frontend
```

The server is then exposed at `http://localhost:3000`. However, it has to be
configured so that it can find the backend and so on. If you're looking something
working out of the box for local development, go to the next section.

## Local development

### Requirements

We advise to use [`nvm` to manage multiple versions of Node](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
If you use `nvm`, `npm` can be upgraded with

```bash
nvm install-latest-npm
```

### Getting started

Notice that contrary to openhexa-app or openhexa-notebook, the advised
environment for local development is not containers.

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, copy `.env.local.dist` and adapt it to your needs:

```bash
cp .env.local.dist .env.local
nano .env.local
```

Before starting the server, the backend [openhexa-app](https://github.com/BLSQ/openhexa-app/)
should be up and running.

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see
the result. If you have followed the
[backend development setup instructions](https://github.com/BLSQ/openhexa-app/#local-development),
you should be able to log in with the listed credentials in those instructions:
`root@openhexa.org`/`root` (please [check](https://github.com/BLSQ/openhexa-app#local-development) if it hasn't 
been updated).

### Configuration

The following environment variables should be provided at build time 
(for the `npm run build`):

- `RELEASE`: a release identifier, such as a Git tag (used for uploading source maps to Sentry)
- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`: A valid Sentry authentication token

The following environment variables should be provided at run time:
- `FALLBACK_URL`: the URL the traffic will be redirected to if Next.js cannot answer the request
- `GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT`: the URL of the OpenHexa GraphQL API
- `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE`: the [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) sampling rate of traces
- `SENTRY_DSN`: the [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) DSN
- `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`: the [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) environment tag

### Code style

We use ESLint (as provided by Next.js) and prettier to format our code.

Lint and format the code using the following command:

```bash
npm run lint && npm run format
```

### Component library

We use [Ladle](https://ladle.dev/) to develop our component library.

Ladle offers a web interface that allows developers to browse and test individual components and their parameters.

You can run Ladle and open its web interface using `npm run ladle`.

## NPM Scripts

* `npm run dev`: Launch Next.js in dev mode and watch files to extract graphql code and generate typescript types and hooks
* `npm run next`: Launch only the Next.js app in dev mode
* `npm run build`: Build the Next.js app
* `npm run start`: Start the app from the build directory (it has to be built before) 
* `npm run test`: Run the tests in watch mode
* `npm run test:ci`: Run all the tests in CI mode
* `npm run lint`: Lint files in `src/` using `eslint`
* `npm run format`: Format files in `src/` using `prettier`
* `npm run prepare`: This script is called automatically by npm on `npm install`. It adds the pre-commit hook
* `npm run schema`: Run an introspection query on the graphql backend and generate a `schema.graphql` file. This file is used to generate typescript types & for DX in the IDE
* `npm run codegen`: Generate typescript types found in all the files based on `schema.graphql`
* `npm run i18n:extract`: Extract translatable strings and write `messages.json` files for each language


## Internationalization

To extract new strings from the `src/` directory, run the extract command:

```bash
npm run i18n:extract
```

Translations are stored in `public/locales/[lang]/[ns].json`.

## Versioning

This library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
Tagging and releases' creation are managed by [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) that will create and maintain a pull request with 
the next release based on the [commit messages of the new commits](#how-should-i-write-my-commits).


Triggering a new release is done by merging the pull request created by release-please. The result is:
* the version in package.json is bumped
* the changelog.md is updated with the commit messages
* a GitHub release is created
* a docker image is built for the new tag and pushed on the docker registry


## How should I write my commits?

This project assumes you are using [Conventional Commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

The most important prefixes you should have in mind are:

* `fix:` which represents bug fixes, and correlates to a [SemVer](https://semver.org/)
  patch.
* `feat:` which represents a new feature, and correlates to a SemVer minor.
* `feat!:`,  or `fix!:`, `refactor!:`, etc., which represent a breaking change
  (indicated by the `!`) and will result in a SemVer major.
