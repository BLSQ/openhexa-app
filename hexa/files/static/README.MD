# Welcome to OpenHEXA!

Welcome to OpenHEXA, the Bluesquare Data Science platform.

This file is an introduction to the workspace bucket. By default, when a workspace is created, it comes with a dedicated GCS bucket.
You can use this bucket to create folders, store files related to this workspace.

We provide also a demo notebooks, and a CSV file you can use to explore for your experimentations.
