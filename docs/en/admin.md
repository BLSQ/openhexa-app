## Organization management

OpenHEXA uses a hierarchical structure where organizations contain multiple workspaces. The organization landing page serves as your control center for managing all aspects of your organization.

### Organization landing page

The organization landing page provides a comprehensive overview and management interface for your entire organization. 


#### Key features

- **Workspaces**: View and manage all workspaces in your organization
- **Members**: View and manage all users in your organization
- **Datasets**: Access all datasets in your organization from one place

### Organization-level roles

OpenHEXA has two organization-level roles that provide different levels of administrative control:

#### 👤 Organization Admin

Organization Admins have comprehensive management capabilities across the entire organization. You can:

- Create, modify, and delete workspaces
- Invite new members to the organization
- Manage user permissions and access levels
- Remove users when necessary

This role is essential for maintaining proper organizational structure and ensuring smooth operations across all workspaces.


#### 👤 Owner

Owners have the highest level of control over an organization. In addition to all Organization Admin capabilities, you can:

- Delete the entire organization and all its contents
- Assign Organization Admin roles
- Manage billing details and subscription plans (when applicable)
